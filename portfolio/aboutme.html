    <h1><u>About me</u></h1>
    <p style="margin: 40px; font-size: large;">
        I am a Java Full Stack Trainee currently expanding my knowledge in frontend and backend development. At Codegnan, I am learning Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining hands-on experience with Spring Framework and RESTful web services. I am also developing my skills in SQL for effective database management. <br><br>

        I hold a Master's degree in Power Electronics and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My previous role as a Junior Software Engineer involved developing user-friendly web applications using React.js and collaborating with teams to deliver quality projects. <br><br>
        
        I am passionate about continuous learning and eager to connect with professionals in the tech industry to explore opportunities for growth and collaboration.
